     sorry for going off without warning! it's been a busy holiday, and without school there's not as much of an excuse for me to use when my parents ask why i'm on my laptop :(. i'll show them this website someday, because i'm very proud of it, but i'm 1. still in the closet, and 2. they don't really like me to interact or use the internet all that much. someday, though, everything will work out.<br>

     hello i'm feeling better today <br>
     <br> a cool and sexy fact about me is that i run a successful liminalcore blog on a certain hellsite. this is my most popular photo:
     <br><img src="../thoughtpics/2020/mylife.jpg" width="400px"><br>
     why are these such a hit<br><br>
     anyways... i'll probably make a gallery of these here as well.

     today my school's schedule is all messed up. i hate it here. i should be HOME by now but instead i'm sitting here surrounded by juniors. <br>
     <br>[rant removed on later date]
     <br>i'm not sure why i'm putting this here, either. i guess it feels nice to put things out into the void. this was supposed to be a post about how i kinda want to be a park ranger lmao

     look, i love all ghibli movies, and i have very extensive thoughts on most of them. spirited away is a wonder, howl's moving castle is a charming delight, and princess mononoke is a masterpiece of film.<br><img src="../../i.makeagif.com/media/1-08-2018/PJzqwt.gif" width="400px"><br>
     but there's something about the studio's 1995 hidden gem, <i> whisper of the heart</i> that just... hits different.<br> it's a low-key and soft coming-of-age film about a girl discovering her place in the world. it centers on creativity, exploration, and romance, and something about it all just touches a little spot within my soul, something raw and so real to me.

    i blame bon for my recently renewed interest in the furry fandom-- her morbid curiosty pairs well with my genuine interest. i got into it at age 13, but have really mellowed out, in my opinion. i don't really bring it up to people unprompted, but i love anthros and the way fursuits move is just,, kinda really cool to me?? i adore digitigrade legs. who knows why.<br>
    anyways, maybe i'll make a page just devoted to this stuff? idk i also mave other pages i am procrastinating on finishing<br>
    <br> video source: wolvinny on twitter. this is my first time ever using the "video" html tag! how could i not, with a vid so perfectly combining coco the corgi with a hatsune miku song??

    it's really been a whole week already? i've been too busy.<br>
    through a recent stroke of luck, i was able to buy an animal crossing switch! i love it so much. i've been playing through age of clam, and it SLAPS as a game. i don't have facebook or twitter, so i can't export my screenshots, but here are some low quality pics of them!
    <img src="../thoughtpics/2020/zeldasnow.jpg" width=400px> <br>
    <img src="../thoughtpics/2020/impaegg.jpg" width=400px> <br>

    <img src="../thoughtpics/2020/babysidon.jpg" width=400px> <br>
    the game is very fun, and made me fall for not only impa, but zelda as well. i love them both!!
