   watching movies that i haven't already seen a thousand times is such a stressful event. it makes me feel so on edge. tv shows aren't like this, so idk why? i pull through but it's uncomfortable for some reason

   my dad blocked the koshka fursuits website on our wifi >:( why?? why not the other fursuit maker sites??? it's so frusterating ugh <br>
   <br> in addition, why isn't neocities blocked yet? does he know? my parents haven't said anything about it, so i'd assume not, but if they found it, what <i>would</i> they say? "we like your website" I WISH lol

   coming to you LIVE from my night class!<br><br> it's a u.s. history course, AND the last class i need to take before i've met all my high school graduation requirements!<br>
   while your typical u.s. history fare is <i>usually</i> my least favorite history, since the revolutionary and civil wars are done to DEATH in elementary and junior high schools here, i have faith in this class. the professor is p entertaining!

   i got yet another job! this time i'm nannying four kids weekdays 1-4:30. we'll see how it goes! <br><br>
   
   thinking about wolf children again. it's <i>such</i> a good film with a beautiful message about letting go and accepting the paths others want to take. 9.1/10, would reccomend.
