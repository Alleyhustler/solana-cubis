    the last few weeks have been a little rough for me. home life can be a real struggle, and school is so overwhelming (don't take 18 college credits a semester, kids! especially if you're baby, like i am). <br><br>
    i'm grappling with the fact that i turn 18 this weekend, and.... i don't know how to feel. it's surreal, almost. on one hand, i feel so old, and ready to escape and be my own person. but on the other, i feel like i'm just a kid. i'm small. it seems like just yesterday was moving day, and just before that, the start of high school.i keep revisiting things i used to love, just to say goodbye, y'know? it's weird, but in an odd way it helps. old shows, ships, sites. <br><br> it's almost funny how nervous i am to have this number put upon me-- it's so arbitrary, yet earth-shattering at the same time.  <br><br>
    i don't know what the future holds, but i'm trying as hard as hell to see it through. sometimes i don't want to, but i will. someday, i will be free, and happy, and true. i won't have to hide anymore. <br><br>
    that's a day i want to see.

    I published a piece of fanfiction for the first time in over a year, yesterday. I think I might make a page for my writing, since, y'know, everything I create must go on this site somehow.

    i woke up this morning thinking fond thoughts about Leo Fire Emblem, so i think i must have had a good ol' FE dream last night.<br>
    <br>it's time to appreciate fates, despite how objectivley broken the story is. i really hope they remake it someday and give it the treatment it deserves (fates walked so three houses could run)<br><br>

    i bought a bunch of pikachu, eevee, and cinnamoroll stuff online last night. it should arrive by the end of the week, and i'm super excited! this marks my first personal online purchase (and YES, i checked that the site is legit). i even got my brother to chip in for shipping costs, since he's getting a hello kitty lanyard :) <br><br>

   my parents won't stop pestering me about whether i have a crush on anyone, and then when i get frusterated at them, they move on to ask about BON. ughhhhhhh <br><br>
   no, i'm pretty sure my goddamn LESBIAN friend isn't interested in any boys at work, MOM. but i can't explain that to you, so you'll just keep asking until you get suspicious<br><br> <span style="font-size:8pt">also i think i'm in the middle of a bi-cycle with a heavy preference for women so uh i'm not gonna have much to impress my mother with either</span></center></div>

    wednesdays and thursdays are such garbage days. on wednesday, i go to school at 8 (with a 20 minute drive), come home at 12, go to work at 1, come home aat 4:30, and then go back to school at 6. thursdays feel similar because i have tap class in the evening, and tuesdays might end up going this way if my parents start making me go to these dumb youth group activities. i need rest<br><br>
    also, i'm sort of at a standstill with this site and it's frusterating. i'm not sure what to add or fix.

    i learned about extreme barbie jeep racing today. i want to do it so badly. it is how i choose to die <br><br>
    
    and UPDATE: i am actually moving forward with the dragon puppet!!!! i'm gonna make grima from fire emblem awakening (or, a slightly cutesy version, anyways. he really is a gnarly looking beast). i told my parents i want to do it, i'm making sketches, and i am very, very happy to actually be moving forward with a project i think of. :)<br>

    how many times can you have a dream about being with a fictional character before it's weird? 2? 3? 4? i think i've passed the threshold. <br><br><br>
