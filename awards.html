   <div class="textboxB"> <center> <h3> The Dewies </h3> </center></div>
   
   <div class="textboxA"> <center> 
   The Dewies: the official Dewside Approved awards ceremony. Sort of like a modern version of the Oscars, or the Dundies. Think your website is up to snuff? Throw it in to the <i>RING OF FIRE</i> and test its strength and resilience during moderate combat. <h5>*the dewies are a completely subjective event. dewside/eliwood is not responsible for the compensation, monetary or otherwise, of bodily damage/injury obtained within the dewies.</h5> <br><br>
   
   Dewie Awards:<br>
   <b>Unique, Fresh, Fantastic</b>: Does your website spark something within me? Find out here! This Award is reserved for sites that I find unique, refreshing, or neat, especially in layout.<br>
   <b>Rabbit Hole Award</b>: An Award for sites with a buttload of content, especially original or fun-to-sift-through content. Art, writing, meme posting- anything goes, as long as I enjoyed seeing a ton of it. <br>
   <b>Party Like It's 1999</b>: Think what I was going for with <a href="https://eligood.neocities.org/">Eligood</a>, here. This Award is for sites that emulate the amature charm of the early web. <br>
   <b>Makes You Go "Awwwww"</b>: A completely subjective Award for sites that I find cute. <br>
   <b>Cringe Comp</b>: Despite the mean name, this is an Award of endearment. Are you a furry? Super into Sonic the Hedgehog? Devoted to cataloging My Little Pony toys? I love it. Take this badge of honor.<br>
   <b>New Kid on the Block</b>: Just starting out? Apply for this award to make me look at your website. A sort of "you showed up!" recognition.<br><br>
   
   RULES:<br>
   -No NSFW sites.<br>
   -Your site has to have a decent amount of content for me to look at/read.<br>
   -Go ahead and apply for more than one Award at once! <br>
   -Original websites only- no social medias!<br>
   -Link to Dewside on your Awards page when you put up your award! <br>
