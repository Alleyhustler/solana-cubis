           WHOOPSIES, A YEAR HAS PASSED<br><br>
           i've been hella busy over the last year. i graduated school and moved to the desert, worked at a really cool
           dinosaur museum as lead educator, fursuited for the first time (it was SO fun and i have my own suit now!) lost my job because of the recession, moved back up north, worked at an aquarium for like 2 months then quit because it sucked so bad (their turnover rate in the education dept is THREE MONTHS on average-- hello?! in 2023 they went thru about 100 employees in that dept... yikes), was unemployed for a bit, and now i have a really fun job as an aide at an elementary school!
