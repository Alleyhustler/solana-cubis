   "He must have been cold, she thought, because he pulled her in closer until she rested underneath his arm; she liked the way they fit together, as if the gods intended it. Neither said a word, and neither needed to."

   Rover is God is a short that I wrote to illustrate a concept I think would be sick for Bon and my Animal Crossing AU thing. For this to make any sense, just accept that in this universe, humans don't exist and Rover serves as a sort of portal between worlds.

   Written: April 2019, Remastered August 2020 <br>
   Word count: 312 <br>
   This is a snippet I wrote while planning a Fire Emblem Heirs of Fate novelization called <i>The Price of Light</i>. I have not done said novelization, but haven't ruled it out as a future undertaking.

   Fire Emblem Fates Crack <br>
   A bizarre exercise in Checkhov's Gun. I really need to keep working on this one, the humor in it is so oddly specific to myself and I personally love that.
