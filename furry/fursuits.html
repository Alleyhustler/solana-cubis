    <div class="textboxB"> <center>  <b>Fursuits</b> are animal costumes designed and worn by furries. These costumes usually are made to represent a <a href="oddball.html">fursona</a>, but can also personify other characters. Not all furries own a fursuit, however, and research indicates that fursuit owners in the fandom are a minority.<br>
    Fursuits can be quite the undertaking. A professionally commissioned suit can run you thousands of dollars, and a homemade one can take several months to contruct.

    Prices: <br>
    Head: Starts at $700 (expected final price: $950)<br>
    Partial: Starts at $900 (expected final price: $1,100)<br>
    Full digitigrade: Starts at 2,000 (expected final price: $2,500)<br>
    <br>
    Notes: I love the expressive and extreme toony style these suits boast! The maker's Instagram page states that you can request a sketch of your character in the style while getting a quote to see if it fits or not, so I most likely will me doing that. They don't offer plantigrade, which is okay because I don't want it <i>at all</i>, but I don't think I've seen many makers out there who skip it entirely. The fullbody price is a little steep for what I'm going for, so if I DO fall in love with the style, I'm going for a partial.

    Full digitigrade: Starts at $1,600<br>

    Notes: Wow! What great prices! I'm definitely going full digitigrade if I go with Koshka. I think that the cat muzzle they used for Toboshiro (see below) would work well on Oddball!
